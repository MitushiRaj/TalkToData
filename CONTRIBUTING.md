# {project name} Contribution and Governance Policies

This document describes the contribution process and governance policies of the NatWest Group {project name} project.

## Contribution Process

Before making a contribution, please take the following steps:
1. Check whether there's already an open issue related to your proposed contribution. If there is, join the discussion and propose your contribution there.
2. If there isn't already a relevant issue, create one, describing your contribution and the problem you're trying to solve.
3. Respond to any questions or suggestions raised in the issue by other developers.
4. Fork the project repository and prepare your proposed contribution.
5. Submit a merge request.

### InnerSource Team Roles and Responsibilities

The project community consists of **Contributors** and **Trusted Committers** and the **Core Maintainer Team**:

* The **Core Maintainer Team** is the core team whose role is to maintain and manage the code base for an InnerSource project. They are responsible for doing the work that is necessary for a healthy usage and contribution ecosystem for their project.Typically this work is not prioritised or received as a contribution but rather provides an essential foundation for contributions. 
  * _[Online Training]_ The ["Core Maintainer Team"](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/p/core-team) definition on the InnerSource Commons website provides an overview of the roles and responsibility of the Core Maintainer Team.
* **Trusted Committers** are engineers that are trusted and highly invested in one (or more) InnerSource projects. They effectively act as an extension of the core team and their primary function is to manage, review and accept contributions which have been submitted by a Contributor. They can also - mentor contributors - lead discussions - help to resolve issues - participate and answer questions where appropriate (Teams Channel, GitLab threads etc.) Achieving Trusted Committer status for an InnerSource project demonstrates significant initiative in contributing to the project. Recognition for these efforts should be captured within our Beyond performance management framework and other reward systems within our organisation.
  * _[Online Training]_ The ["Trusted Committer Learning Path"](https://innersourcecommons.org/learn/learning-path/trusted-committer/) on the InnerSource Commons website provides a series of educational resources that explain the InnerSource Trusted Committer role.
* **Contributors** are anyone who submits a contribution to the project. (Contributions may include code, issues, comments, documentation, media, or any combination of the above). 
  * _[Online Training]_ ["Becoming an InnerSource Contributor"](https://innersourcecommons.org/learn/learning-path/contributor/02/) on the InnerSource Commons website explains the role of the InnerSource contributor. 

### Contribution Rules

Anyone is welcome to submit a contribution to the project. The rules below apply to all contributions. (The key words "MUST", "SHALL", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc. in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).)

* All contributions MUST be submitted as merge requests, including contributions by the Core Maintainers / Trusted Committers.
* All merge requests SHOULD be reviewed by a Maintainer / Trusted Committer (other than the Contributor) before being merged.
* Merge requests for non-trivial contributions SHOULD remain open for a review period sufficient to give all Maintainers / Trusted Committers a sufficient opportunity to review and comment on them.
* After the review period, if no Maintainer / Trusted Committer has an objection to the merge request, any Maintainer / Trusted Committer MAY merge it.
* If any Maintainer / Trusted Committer objects to a merge request, the Maintainers / Trusted Committers SHOULD try to come to consensus through discussion. If not consensus can be reached, any Maintainer / Trusted Committer MAY call for a vote on the contribution.

### Changes to this Document

This document MAY be amended by a vote of the Maintainers / Trusted Committers with the oversight of the NatWest Open Source Program Office.
